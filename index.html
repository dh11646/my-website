       <h2> Michael Schumacher </h2>
       <p> Since Michael Schumacher retired in 2012 he holds 7 world championships (tied with Lewis Hamilton), 91 wins, 155 podium finishes, and 68 pole positions.<br>
       He was born January 3, 1969, Hürth-Hermülhein, West Germany (now in Germany). As a youth, Schumacher became interested in go-kart racing,<br>
       this was supported by the fact that his father managed a go-kart track. In 1984 and 1985 he won the German junior karting championship, and in 1987 he had won<br>
       the German and European karting titles. The year after, when he was at age 19, he retired from karting and became a Formula Three driver (these vehicles were/are less<br>
       powerful than formula 1 cars). Two years later, in 1990, he had won the German F3 championship.
        
       In 1991, he had upgraded to Formula 1, and joined the Jordan team. He switched to Benetton the following year and won the drivers’ world championship for the team in<br>
       1994 and 1995. Before the 1996 season he moved to the Ferrari team and finished third in the championship standings. Schumacher went on to win a third championship<br>
       the succeeding year. His 2000 win was the first in a string of five consecutive world championships, and his grand total of seven world titles broke Juan Manuel Fangio’s<br>
       record of five that had stood for nearly 50 years. Schumacher retired at the end of the 2006 season to serve as a test driver and adviser for Ferrari.<br>
       In late December 2009, Schumacher announced that he would return to F1 for the 2010 season as a driver for Mercedes. He carried on three seasons with Mercedes,<br>
       but never won a race and never finished higher than eighth in the overall standings, and retired again in 2012.
