       <h2> Michael Schumacher </h2>
       <p> Since Michael Schumacher retired in 2012 he holds 7 world championships (tied with Lewis Hamilton), 91 wins, 155 podium finishes, and 68 pole positions.<br>
       He was born January 3, 1969, Hürth-Hermülhein, West Germany (now in Germany). As a youth, Schumacher became interested in go-kart racing,<br>
       this was supported by the fact that his father managed a go-kart track. In 1984 and 1985 he won the German junior karting championship, and in 1987 he had won<br>
       the German and European karting titles. The year after, when he was at age 19, he retired from karting and became a Formula Three driver (these vehicles were/are less<br>
       powerful than formula 1 cars). Two years later, in 1990, he had won the German F3 championship.
